# Open Data Cube Labs
__Developing features and extensions related to the ODC code-base that may or may not be incorporated into the ODC in the future.__

## Rationale
The goal of the  ODC Labs environment is to develop and test new features for improving or adapting the ODC that may involve breaking, experimental or otherwise extensive changes not suited to the [production ODC code base](https://github.com/opendatacube) and the [community](https://www.opendatacube.org/) it supports. Improvements and adaptations may include speed, ease of use, memory performance, adaptability, modularity, API changes and so on.

CSIRO as a founding member of the ODC and a science organisation hosts the ODC Labs on behalf of the ODC community. This isn't a separate initiative to the ODC production area but a fully integrated part of the ecosystem. The separate hosting is simply to help reduce confusion in the production area and to support creative new directions and innovation in a collaborative environment. 

**You or your organisation are welcome to propose an ODC Labs project or get involved in an existing one. All ODC community members are welcome to participate.**
- **Contact the [CSIRO EASI core team](https://github.com/orgs/csiro-easi/teams/easi-core) to get started.**

You can find a list of current ODC Labs projects on the [Projects tab of this repository](https://github.com/csiro-easi/opendatacube-labs-docs/projects). Each contains a description of the project and all ODC Labs repositories and projects are pre-fixed by "opendataube-labs". 

Research and operational agencies may choose to adopt new features from the ODC Labs when the new features can be shown to work better for their deployment(s) - just pull the appropriate repository. Be aware though, there is no expectation, nor requirement, that any or all ODC Labs features will be adopted into the production open data cube code. Indeed, the nature of an experimental test-bed is that backwards-compatibility may well be broken in the advance of new or bespoke features. When/If an ODC Lab project graduates to production it will do so through the usual Pull Request approach into the [production ODC code base](https://github.com/opendatacube). If you like a particular ODC Labs feature then you should definitely get in touch and lobby for the transition to occur!

To help get your creative juices thinking here are a range of ODC Labs projects people are thinking about:
+ Linking computational modelling and the ODC for forecasting events
+ Machine learning
+	Feature detection and feature based API
+	Interoperability challenges between EO Data Cubes
+	Algorithms for generating decision-ready products
+ Multi-sensor data integration and analysis
+ Hyperspectral and SAR analysis
+ New innovative tools and solutions to work with EO Data Cubes
+ Support for high resolution EO data
+ Cloud-based computation and storage models
+ Architecture design of EO Data Cubes (HPC, Distributed Computing, Super Computers)
+ Multi-source and destination data cache management for organisation deployments
